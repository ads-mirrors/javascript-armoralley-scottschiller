`The latest and greatest: April 2025 Edition 🗞️`
This is a summary of work in progress. For code-level details, see the changelog section below.

`Graphics / Performance`

· Hi-DPI / "Retina" screen support for 2x+ resolution rendering, sharp graphics. May impact performance on older devices.

· New preferences panel for 30 / 60 fps and graphics options, hi-DPI and enhanced radar FX.

· If the game switches automatically to 30 fps due to performance, hi-DPI and enhanced radar FX will be disabled. Un-check "choose best" to override.

· Turret + missile launcher scan nodes now drawn on `<canvas>` instead of HTML + CSS. Much more efficient. GPU RAM use from 400+ MB down to 40 MB (@ full-screen 4K retina resolution) with many missile launchers on screen.

`UI miscellany`

· Fixed shrapnel and "sparks" embedding in targets on impact, and fading out.

· Updated primary UI typeface: "Iosveka" - clean, tall and legible.

· Game tips use Times New Roman-style serif type, like the original Mac version.

`Helicopter / Mouse "Physics" Update`

· The battlefield view scrolls with the chopper more smoothly, leaving more space to see inbound units.

· Helicopter responsiveness: Slightly more "realistic" response to horizontal velocity changes, not as fast as a mouse cursor. Bomb targeting, etc., may require some adjustments.

· Horizontal movement: The helicopter is more responsive to horizontal mouse position. Previously, you had to move the mouse near the screen edges for top speed.

`Game Statistics V2.0`

· Game stats: time, score, inventory and other details when battle is won or lost. "Copy to clipboard" for those who might be interested.

· Work in progress: Support for posting game stats to Discord or Slack via webhooks.

`Gamepad Support: V1.0 🎮`

· Designed for "standard" game controller layout - e.g., XBOX and PlayStation: two joysticks, one D-pad, ABXY and shoulder buttons. Desktop + mobile. Rumble features where supported. (From testing: Chrome and Safari on desktop.)

· Disclaimers: See game settings for control mappings. Support for controllers varies across devices and browsers. USB connection may be required as seen in testing on Safari, macOS + iOS.

`Game Behaviours: Scoring + Funds 💰`

· Score, bonus, battle / difficulty display in top right. Bonus is based on friendly units (and difficulty), and added to your score when you win.

· Updated earning of funds, like original: awarded at a fixed interval, depending on distance into enemy territory, battle and difficulty.

· End bunker fund capture: Infantry capture 50% of available funds (optional preference: engineers can "rob the bank" for 100%), end bunker is neutralized, local funds go to -25 (original game showed "captured" in this state.) "Reclaim" end bunker to reset funds to 0, or earn 25+ funds over time.

`Munitions, Weapons &amp; Units 💣`

· Tank gunfire hits and can destroy bunkers like original, e.g., when firing at some other target.

· Tank gunfire passes thru super bunkers, like original. (Tanks use flamethrowers to "clear out" super bunkers and end bunkers.)

· "Napalm" battle flag: bombs spark on the ground, vs. wider explosion when equipped with napalm - more effective at taking out infantry + engineers.

· "Stealth" battle flag: Enemy helicopter is always hidden on radar.

· "Jamming" battle flag: Radar is always jammed, unavailable.

· The last missing weapon: "aimed" AKA "dumb" missiles armed with napalm, which replace helicopter ammunition on some battles.

· Smart missile and turret targeting updated, closer to original.

· Per original: some turrets only target "ground" units (e.g., tanks) instead of helicopters.

· It turns out that infantry _do_ carry grenades after all, for one specific case.

· Engineers lose their backpacks and become infantry when picked up "in the field," but sometimes there is a strategic reason to do so. 💭😉

· Vans now jam radar at variable distances, depending on battle + difficulty.

· As in the original, "flame burns both sides" - bombs with napalm, aimed missile napalm, and tank flamethrowers can hit friendly infantry and engineers.

`Inventory 🚚`

· Inventory / ordering limits per original: "Requisition denied - quota exceeded" - no more than 15 tanks, 6 missile launchers, 10 vans, and 30 "men" between engineers, infantry and paratroopers.

`Enemy "IQ" 🧠`

· Updated enemy helicopter "AI": seek, evade, wander etc., now using improved vectors and "autonomous agent"-style steering logic.

· Updated enemy behaviour switching to mimic original: attack, defend, steal.

· The enemy helicopter can drop paratroopers to take out turrets and capture bunkers, including super bunkers and your end bunker (which means, stealing funds.) It can also recapture its own end bunker.

· "All-new" enemy convoy ordering patterns varying by battle, timing and difficulty - based on the original.

· Battle selection menu now shows calculated IQ + fairness + "flags" (weapons / radar details) based on difficulty, like the original.

· The enemy helicopter can fire smart missiles at turrets, respawn faster, and take other countermeasures based on the battle and difficulty.

· The enemy helicopter can now drop "decoy" paratroopers for, and try to shoot down incoming smart missiles.

`Miscellaneous`

· Gamepad and touch support: helicopter flight control has been adjusted to be more usable across varying screen sizes.

· Like the original, you can now crash into the ground if flying too fast.

· "Unlimited helicopters" preference: for a challenge, turn this off and buy additional helicopters @ 20 funds ea. as per original game.

· Battle victory messages and medals are now awarded as you progress through the original campaign battles and difficulties.

· Original game feature: Hold `shift/ctrl/x/z` (within 1 second) to delay respawn, keep watching scene where you died.

· Updated radial energy UI. Shown when units are damaged, and/or repairing.

· Updated radar UI, increased detail for scannability of buildings and ground units.
